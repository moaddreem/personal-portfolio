## About the Event

FTC Jam was a standout experience for me. It's the first game-development hackathon in Saudi Arabia designed specifically for high school students. The event took serious effort to organize and shape, and the turnout was strong, which made the impact feel real.

## My Role & Result

I joined as a mentor, supporting one team throughout the hackathon. The team I mentored won 1st place. What made it special wasn't just the win, it was seeing how fast they improved under pressure and how seriously they took the craft.

## The Award Moment

Another meaningful moment was receiving the award from Dr. Yusra, the Head of the Computer Science Department (women's campus). It was a proud moment that reflected the effort behind mentoring and building real community impact.

## Closing

FTC Jam reminded me why I enjoy mentoring: real growth, real teamwork, and real outcomes.
