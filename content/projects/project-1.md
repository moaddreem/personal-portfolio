## Overview

"Fakhr Al-Suwaidi" began as an in-film game concept. The director, Osama Saleh, reached out and asked us to bring that game to life as a real, playable experience. We worked through Pixel Studio to turn the idea into something people could actually play.

## My Role

I owned the project end-to-end from a project management perspective. I led the planning, ran meetings, built timelines, organized tasks and deliverables, and kept execution moving until delivery. I also designed the website experience to match the project's identity and make the release feel polished.

## What We Built

We delivered a promo website for the film and a fully web-based game, so players can jump in instantly with no downloads. The experience was built to run smoothly across devices, working on mobile and laptop, with both touch controls and keyboard arrows. The focus was a polished, accessible release that feels great to play and easy to share.

## Execution & Delivery

We focused on keeping the scope realistic, shipping a finished result, and making sure every piece was coordinated: the game experience, the release assets, and the website. The goal was a clean delivery, not just a prototype.
