## Overview

GameBox 4 is officially done, and it wasn't "just a hackathon." It was a full-on experience: fast learning, teams building under pressure, last-minute fixes, loud laughs, and the kind of energy you only get when a community truly shows up.

## Scale & Impact

We brought together 100+ participants with 90+ team members, alongside mentors, sponsors, workshops, Unity sessions, and deep dives into game design. Making all of it feel seamless took serious coordination behind the scenes.

## My Role

I'm proud to have been part of this effort, and even prouder of the team that pushed through the chaos with discipline and heart. Seeing participants walk away with games, confidence, and real memories made every long night worth it.

I genuinely wished I was in Saudi Arabia to be there in person. Even at a distance, my heart was with the team the whole time.
