## Problem

Higher education teams often struggle with scattered evidence, time-consuming reporting, and limited visibility into learning outcomes. Academic program management involves juggling accreditation requirements, curriculum alignment, and student progress tracking across disconnected systems.

## Solution

ITQAN is my graduation project, designed to reduce the manual workload in academic program management. It brings accreditation, curriculum alignment, and student progress tracking into one connected platform.

## Key Modules

### TAWTHIQ
Automates accreditation evidence collection and report readiness. Supports ABET/NCAAA style reporting with structured document management and compliance tracking.

### MANHAJ
Supports curriculum management by aligning courses, CLOs (Course Learning Outcomes), and PLOs (Program Learning Outcomes). Highlights gaps and ensures curriculum coherence.

### IRSHAD
A student-facing AI assistant that helps students understand their progress and learning outcomes with personalized insights and recommendations.

## Outcome

ITQAN transforms how academic programs handle accreditation and curriculum management, reducing manual effort and providing clear visibility into program health and student progress.
