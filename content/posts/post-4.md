I've always been curious about AI, but for a while, it felt like something I was circling around without really diving in. I wanted a real foundation—not just surface-level tutorials, but something that would actually push me and make things click.

That's when I found KAUST Academy's AI Specialization.

## Stage 1: Building the Base

The first stage was fully online and Coursera-based. Honestly, I wasn't sure what to expect at first, but I decided to take it seriously. I completed every module, every quiz, every assignment.

Looking back, this stage was crucial. It built the foundation I needed—the math, the intuition, the core concepts. Without it, the later stages wouldn't have made sense.

## Stage 2: Where Things Got Real

Stage 2 is where everything leveled up.

We went deeper into machine learning, with a strong focus on tabular data and practical applications. But the highlight? Getting a solid introduction to Neural Networks. That's when AI stopped being abstract and started feeling like something I could actually build with.

One thing I have to mention: our instructor, **Shaden Al-Shammari**, who studied at MIT. Learning from someone with that background was honestly huge. She made complex topics feel approachable, and her energy made the sessions genuinely enjoyable.

Here's the thing—I wasn't just studying to pass. I was actually having fun. The material was challenging, but it was the kind of challenge that makes you want to keep going.

And then came the exam.

Let me be honest: it was brutal. One of the toughest exams I've taken. But even with that intensity, it felt rewarding. The kind of hard that makes you feel like you actually earned something.

## Stage 3: Qualified and Moving Forward

I'm happy to say I qualified for Stage 3.

I haven't completed it yet, but I'm excited for what's coming. Once I finish Stage 3—and if I qualify for the next stage—I'll publish a follow-up post with the full story.

## What KAUST Academy Gave Me

This program pushed me in ways I didn't expect. It made AI feel more real, more tangible. It improved how I learn, how I approach problems, and how I think about building things.

If you're considering it—go for it. It's not easy, but that's exactly why it's worth it.
