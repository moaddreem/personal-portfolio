This was my first trip outside Saudi Arabia, and it honestly reset my perspective.

Right after finishing my midterm exams, we got a one-week break. I decided to take the step and travel to China with my friend Khalid Al-Faleh. It turned into one of the best 10 days of my life, no exaggeration. The world felt bigger in the best way possible—new places, new energy, and a level of tech and everyday experiences I wasn't expecting.

## Beijing (4 Days)

We started in Beijing, and it was the perfect intro to China.

### The Forbidden City

The Forbidden City was one of the biggest highlights. The scale, the details, the history… it felt like walking through a real chapter of a different world. I've read about it, seen it in documentaries, but standing there in person is something else entirely.

### The Great Wall

I've seen it a thousand times in photos, but seeing it in real life is different. The moment I stood there, I finally understood why it's called "Great." It's one of those places that makes you feel small in a good way—and weirdly motivated at the same time.

### What surprised me most

One thing that really stood out: how strongly people hold onto their culture. It didn't feel "watered down." It felt like a place that knows what it is. And yes, we also visited a university in Beijing during the trip, which was a cool moment for me personally. It made me think about where I want to be and what I want to build in the future.

## Shanghai (4 Days)

After Beijing, we took the train to Shanghai—and the vibe changed completely. More modern, faster, and full of movement.

We explored spots like Nanjing Road, Wukang Mansion, Yu Garden Market, and a few other landmarks that were honestly all worth it.

### Traditional Streets & Markets

Beyond the modern skyline, Shanghai still has pockets of traditional culture. The old streets and night markets were some of my favorite moments—full of energy, food, and that classic vibe you can't find anywhere else.

### Ending it at Shanghai Disneyland

We ended the trip at Shanghai Disneyland, and it was the perfect finale. On the way back, I watched Zootopia 1 to get ready for Zootopia 2 (had to do it).

## What I Took From This Trip

This trip wasn't just tourism. It was a "wake up" moment.

It made me feel that the world is much bigger than we think, and there's so much to learn and experience outside what we're used to. I genuinely loved the civilization and culture there—the history, the people, the way tradition and modernity coexist. I enjoyed it, learned a lot, and I'm sure this won't be my last visit to China.

## Thank You

From the heart, thank you to everyone who pushed me to take this step and helped make the trip this beautiful:

My mom and dad, Natasha, Brittney, Edgar, and Yeer.

And a special thanks to my travel partner Khalid—I couldn't have asked for a better person to travel with.
