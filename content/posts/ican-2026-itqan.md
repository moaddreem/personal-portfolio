During ICAN 2026 (Jan 28–29) my teammates and I showcased our graduation project ITQAN — a solution built to improve academic program development by making quality workflows clearer, faster, and more consistent.

## What is ICAN?

It's a conference and exhibition focused on data and AI capacity building, bringing together organizations, initiatives, and projects to share practical use-cases and real impact.

## We were also honored by the visit of:

- The Acting President of the University, Prof. Ali Masmali
- The Dean of the College of Computer and Information Sciences, Abdulmajeed Alameer, PhD

And we genuinely appreciate the leaders and representatives from other universities who stopped by, asked questions, and gave feedback.

## None of this would've happened without Allah first, then this team:

- Abdulsalam AlAbdulkarim
- Muath Almansour
- Mohammed Alzeer
- Mansour Alahmri
